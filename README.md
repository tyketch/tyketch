Hi 👋 I'm Ty! Currently, I'm building an analytics strategy and community at Textron Aviation ✈️.

I've spent my career in multiple industries and disciplines - from Data to Finance to Ops.

This page is intended to help others understand what it might be like to work with me, especially people who haven’t worked with me before. It's also a well-intentioned effort at building some trust by being intentionally vulnerable, and to share my ideas of a good working relationship to reduce the anxiety of people who might be on my team.

* 💡 I'm an [ESTJ](https://www.16personalities.com/estj-personality). While not perfect, understanding personality types helps me better collaborate with YOU!
* 📫 Reach me: [linkedin.com/in/tyketchum/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tyketchum/)
* ⚡ Fun fact: I'm an avid cyclist 🚴, ⚽ fan, and bookworm.
